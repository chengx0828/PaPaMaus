# Please write a function called std that takes no arguments and returns a string containing a SQL query that can be run against the auctions.db database that outputs a table that has two columns: itemId and std, the standard deviation of bids for that item. Include only bids for which the unbiased standard deviation can be calculated (that is, those with at least two bids). Calculate standard deviation as
